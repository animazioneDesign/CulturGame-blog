# CulturGame Blog


This repo contains the whole <[culturGame-blog](https://animazionedesign.it/culturGame-blog)> website.

## Requirements

- Local development server running PHP 7.4+ (e.g. Apache, nginx, MAMP).

Webiste structure
/assets
JS, CSS, Stylus files all separated

/content
It's the main file based database in markdown. Basically everything here is generated from the website iself using the panel, normally there is no manual intervention here

/kirby
Official kirby core, nothing to touch

/media
Temporary thmbnails generated by kirby, nothing to touch (eventually erase everything if the files aren't updatening properly)

/node_modules
Extra node modules used to generate the css and run the website, automated folder

/site
Main folder containing the blueprints (panel "forms" structure written in YAML), pages templates (actual html/php page structure, no css or js here), snippets (repeating parts that makes sense to split for maintenance, like footer, header, head, ...).

Snippets are imported in the templates using <?php snippet('footer') ?>

Usual snippets: head (title, meta, css/js link), header (add in intself the head at the beginning and normally contains the nav menu), footer

head.php
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">

<head>
	<meta ....>
	<title></title>
	<link ...>

	<!-- stylesheet links -->
	<?= css('assets/css/main.css') ?>
</head>

header.php
<?php snippet('head') ?>

<header>
	<nav>
		<ul>
			<li>....</li>
			....
		</ul>
	</nav>
</header>

footer.php
<footer>
	<div>.....</div>
</footer>
any_page_template.php
<?php snippet('header') ?>

<body>

	<main>
	<h1>....</h1>

	<section, article, div, ....></...>

	</main>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>

</body>
Blueprint and template file name has to match to automatically be recognised (portfolio.yml, portfolio.php). This will generate a markdown file that use this blueprint/template in the content folder (portfolio.md) once that form the panel a new page with this template is created.

/site/config
Main config file, where to indicate to allow the installation of the panel, activate de debug mode, add the sitemap, ...

All the other folders in the /site are not necessary to know about. Just for advanced stuffs

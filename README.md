# Customisation
If you use CodeKit, feel free to import the theme’s folder to it and start making changes. CodeKit will handle the recompiling of SASS & JS thanks to the *config.codekit3* file in the root directory.

You can easily change the colors and overall styles of the theme by editing and recompiling its */assets/sass styles*. As you’ll see the main colors are separated in */assets/sass/_palette.scss*. From */assets/sass/components/_typography.scss* you can easily change the font faces used for Kompact.
